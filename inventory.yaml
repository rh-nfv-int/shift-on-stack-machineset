      # name: Name or UUID of the network to attach to the worker VM(s)
      #       If a network name is given, the name is use to lookup the UUID
      #       of the network in the current tenant.
      # name_suffix: Trunking is enabled for ports that are created by 
      #              entries in the networks and subnets lists. The names 
      #              of ports that are created from these lists follow 
      #              the pattern <machine_name>-<nameSuffix>. The 
      #              nameSuffix field is required in port definitions.
      #              When using the name of the network to attach,
      #              nameSuffix should equal the name.
      # tags: Additional tags added to the port.  By default the playbook will
      #       1. add a tag for the UUID of the network in form netid_UUID.  
      #       2. add a tag for the vnic_type
      #       3. add a tag for the driver type
